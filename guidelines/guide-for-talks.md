# Guide for Talk Proposals at Paralelná Polis Košice

### 1. Purpose:
Our aim at Paralelná Polis Košice is to foster an environment for open discussion centered around data-driven approaches, well-researched topics, and robust empirical studies. To uphold the quality of our events, we have outlined the following guidelines for talk proposals.

### 3. Dataset/Studies:
Every talk at Paralelná Polis Košice should be rooted in evidence.

- **Primary Sources**: Indicate the primary data sets, academic papers, or empirical studies that form the backbone of your talk.
- **Supporting Evidence**: List any secondary or tertiary sources, reports, and data you'll reference.
- **Relevance**: Ensure that the studies/data are recent and relevant to the topic at hand.

### 4. Content Guidelines:
